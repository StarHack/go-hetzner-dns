# go-hetzner-dns

This is my implementation of golang support for the [Hetzner Public DNS API](https://dns.hetzner.com/api-docs). This project was part of a self-built ACME client implementation.

## Sample usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/StarHack/go-hetzner-dns"
)

func main() {
	h := hetzner.Hetzner{APIKey: "<your_api_key>"}
	zones, err := h.FindAllZones()

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	for _, zone := range zones {
		fmt.Println(zone.Name)
	}
}
```
